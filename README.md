In order to escape University, you must collect all six valuable items that spread all over the campus without being spotted by the chancellor that located in his room. To escape, you will need to collect your phone from the Social Studies room, to grab your laptop while jogging through the IT lab, to be equipped with a Calculator from the Math room, as well as the beaker from the Chemistry lab, and the magnet from the Physics lab. Lastly, be sure to get the big blue book from the History auditorium that located next to the chancellor room. Be sure not to interrupt the chancellor during his meeting without having all the items handy otherwise, it will be the end of you studies at the campus. To escape, make sure to reach the chancellor with all the items you collected. Trust me, me will be checking your knowledge.
